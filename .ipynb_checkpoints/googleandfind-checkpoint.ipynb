The Home Minister has spoken for him, and it is sad that he lied.\n",

      "In one of his recent interviews he said that the idea behind giving no notice before that first lockdown was to try and keep migrant workers from carrying the virus back to their villages. But, then he told his first lie. He said that full arrangements had been made for the suddenly homeless and jobless workers to be provided shelter and food in the cities. Not true.

      "New Delhi: While a blanket reimposition of a lockdown by the Centre is not on the cards, PM Narendra Modi is expected to tell the CMs to not lower their guard in the Covid-19 urban containment zones A senior government official told ET that the PM could ask the CMs to go for extensive door-to-door screening of people living in urban containment zones and be stricter in implementation of social distancing measures and usage of face masks. The Centre has received a feedback that things have turned complacent in some states. Modi is also expected to ask certain states to increase their testing numbers by the end of June to be able to detect patients early and reduce mortality.The meetings are scheduled on June 16 and 17 in two batches with the worst-affected states slotted for Day 2. “States have to call the shots now but closer central coordination is needed. The PM is expected to seek the CMs’ suggestions and draw up a common strategy. There is no plan to reimpose a blanket lockdown. For us, the test positivity ratio, which stands at 5.6% nationally, is the most important indicator as to how a state is doing against Covid-19. The key is to enforce social distancing norms effectively and impose fines if the same is not adhered to,” said the official.States will have the liberty to go for stricter measures if the need be. For example, Punjab has gone for a stricter lockdown on weekends and Rajasthan chose to close its borders this week, said the official.The Centre is pleased with the recovery rate crossing 50% on Sunday but is equally worried about the rising strain on health infrastructure as there are close to 1.5 lakh active cases now. “The capacity utilisation is not there in some states such as UP while it is stretched in other places like Delhi,” another senior official told ET.\n",

      "Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India has announced a new ‘One Sun One World One Grid’ vision for India to replicate its global solar leadership by encouraging the phased development towards a single, globally connected, electricity grid to leverage the multiple benefits of ever-lower-cost renewable energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Countries like India have huge natural renewable energy resources and accelerated investment in low-cost, zero-pollution sustainable energy, with increased scale driving faster electricity deflation is a win.\n",
      "\n",
      "The national grid benefits from a greater capacity to integrate low-cost but intermittent renewable energy, while at the same time exporting surplus low-cost renewable energy at times of peak generation and building grid capacity to import electricity (say from Bhutan) at times of peak evening demand, when the sun has set.\n",
      "\n",
      "India currently relies on some $US250 billion of fossil fuel imports a year (oil, diesel, LNG, coking and thermal coal). One Sun, One World would put the country on a path to leverage domestic energy resources and progressively develop world competitive sustainable renewable energy exports, improving the current account deficit and reducing imported inflation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using renewable energy means less water scarcity and reduced particulate and air pollution. Globalinvestors have shown a clear, growing propensity to invest in India’s renewable energy ambitions (when backed by sound government contracts), and to support the grid infrastructure those ambitions need.\n",
      "\n",
      "For an added benefit, India could move to centre stage globally, accelerating the energy system’s decarbonisation, and helping to end a global climate crisis that India did not create.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of an internationally connected electricity grid is not new. Decades ago the elite Club of Rome and some associates launched Desertec to leverage the vast natural resources of Northern Africa as a supply of zero-emissions solar and wind energy to Europe, with futuristic plans of subsea cables from Morocco to Gibraltar, and Tunisia to Sicily then Italy to leverage the unlimited solar wealth of the Sahara Desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only after ‘learning by doing’ at industrial scale from installing wind turbines in the North Sea has the growing commercial viability of subsea electricity cabling been proven, at ever increasing capacities, while unit costs have declined dramatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology of high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) cabling has advanced phenomenally over the last decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The North Sea Network Link between Norway and the UK is a 1,400 megawatt (MW), 515kV, 730 kilometre (km) connection due for completion in 2021, with cable manufactured by Prysmian of Italy – the world leader in cables.\n",
      "\n",
      "This builds on a number of shorter, lower capacity connections. Back in 1986 the second cross-channel England-France grid connection was commissioned, with 2000MW of 270kV cable covering 73km. In 2011 the BritNed 260km 1,000MW, 450kV grid link between England and the Netherlands was completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, an international consortium of SoftBank of Japan, State Grid Corp of China, KEPCO of Korea proposed a very ambitious Northeast Asia grid strategy to link the national Mongolia-China-South Korea-Japan grids.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in 2019 Thailand relaunched efforts to build a South East Asian grid connectivity system to better distribute the hydro-electricity of the greater Mekong River across Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Since 2018, Malaysia has imported 100MW from Laos via Thailand, rising to 300MW from 2020 (known as the Lao PDR, Thailand, Malaysia – Power Integration Project).\n",
      "\n",
      "n late 2019 Sun Cables received preliminary funding commitments for its exceptionally ambitious nation-building 3,800km Darwin-Singapore subsea cable proposal.\n",
      "\n",
      "For many years, India has pursued international electricity trade. Bhutan-India has an international grid connectivity (with ambitious but long-delayed plans to develop some of the 30GW of Bhutan hydro capacity potential).\n",
      "\n",
      "India-Nepal grid capacity has progressively grown to some 450MW and India-Bangladesh is 1,160MW (with a doubling of capacity being built currently by Adani to export electricity from its 1,496MW Godda import coal-fired power plant in Jharkhand to Bangladesh). However, trade is largely one-directional, importing hydroelectricity from Bhutan and exporting to Nepal and Bangladesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ongoing solar energy deflation makes these global visions of the past a potential reality now, and more compelling as this new decade unfolds. Grid connectivity can leverage the time difference between countries to best utilise intermittent but low-cost solar and wind power generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coupled with connectivity with Bhutan’s and Nepal’s hydro-electricity capacity can maximise supply at times of more valuable peak power demand, and best exploit the divergent natural resources of different countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gautam Adani, Chairman of Adani Group, has referenced how solar costs have dropped 99% in the last four decades, and are on track to drop another 99% in the next 40 years. He calls for a “Green Energy Acceleration in the Post Covid World”.\n",
      "\n",
      "This changes everything. Virtually free renewable energy is entirely foreseeable, but only if we develop a cost-effective way of time-shifting production to when it is needed (via batteries and renewable hydrogen), time-shifting electricity demand (demand response management) and/or through significantly expanded inter-state and international grid connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina first discussed India exporting its exceptionally low-cost solar energy from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Bangladesh in 2019. Even accounting for the grid transmission costs doubling the cost of delivered electricity, with solar as low as Rs2.50/kWh (and going below Rs2 later this decade), this power can be delivered at a substantial discount to Bangladesh’s wholesale electricity price, which is double that of India due to Bangladesh’s increasing reliance on expensive, dirty, imported coal, diesel and LNG.\n",
      "\n",
      "The One Sun, One World, One Grid vision goes further. A 1,000km subsea HVDC connection from Oman to Gujarat would take ultra-low cost solar electricity (built by leading installers like India’s very own Sterling & Wilson) in the middle of the Oman and UAE afternoon and deliver it into the evening peak in Dhaka. Adding to solar from Ladakh and hydro-electricity from Nepal, potentially to Colombo as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virtually unlimited low-cost renewables are available today at massive scale in India, with zero inflation indexation for 25 years. This is entirely sustainable power producing no carbon emissions and no air or water pollution. Deflationary green exports can realistically entirely replace expensive, inflationary, polluting fossil fuel imports, with vision and international co-operation, bringing employment and international investment.\n",

Decades ago the elite Club of Rome and some associates launched Desertec to leverage the vast natural resources of Northern Africa as a supply of zero-emissions solar and wind energy to Europe, with futuristic plans of subsea cables from Morocco to Gibraltar, and Tunisia to Sicily then Italy to leverage the unlimited solar wealth of the Sahara Desert.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only after ‘learning by doing’ at industrial scale from installing wind turbines in the North Sea has the growing commercial viability of subsea electricity cabling been proven, at ever increasing capacities, while unit costs have declined dramatically.\n",
      "\n",
      "The technology of high-voltage, direct current (HVDC) cabling has advanced phenomenally over the last decade.\n",
      "\n",
      "The North Sea Network Link between Norway and the UK is a 1,400 megawatt (MW), 515kV, 730 kilometre (km) connection due for completion in 2021, with cable manufactured by Prysmian of Italy – the world leader in cables.\n",
      "\n",
      "This builds on a number of shorter, lower capacity connections. Back in 1986 the second cross-channel England-France grid connection was commissioned, with 2000MW of 270kV cable covering 73km. In 2011 the BritNed 260km 1,000MW, 450kV grid link between England and the Netherlands was completed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2016, an international consortium of SoftBank of Japan, State Grid Corp of China, KEPCO of Korea proposed a very ambitious Northeast Asia grid strategy to link the national Mongolia-China-South Korea-Japan grids.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in 2019 Thailand relaunched efforts to build a South East Asian grid connectivity system to better distribute the hydro-electricity of the greater Mekong River across Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia and Vietnam. Since 2018, Malaysia has imported 100MW from Laos via Thailand, rising to 300MW from 2020 (known as the Lao PDR, Thailand, Malaysia – Power Integration Project).\n",

      "\n",
      "India-Nepal grid capacity has progressively grown to some 450MW and India-Bangladesh is 1,160MW (with a doubling of capacity being built currently by Adani to export electricity from its 1,496MW Godda import coal-fired power plant in Jharkhand to Bangladesh). However, trade is largely one-directional, importing hydroelectricity from Bhutan and exporting to Nepal and Bangladesh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ongoing solar energy deflation makes these global visions of the past a potential reality now, and more compelling as this new decade unfolds. Grid connectivity can leverage the time difference between countries to best utilise intermittent but low-cost solar and wind power generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coupled with connectivity with Bhutan’s and Nepal’s hydro-electricity capacity can maximise supply at times of more valuable peak power demand, and best exploit the divergent natural resources of different countries.\n",

      "Gautam Adani, Chairman of Adani Group, has referenced how solar costs have dropped 99% in the last four decades, and are on track to drop another 99% in the next 40 years. He calls for a “Green Energy Acceleration in the Post Covid World”.\n",
      "\n",
      "This changes everything. Virtually free renewable energy is entirely foreseeable, but only if we develop a cost-effective way of time-shifting production to when it is needed (via batteries and renewable hydrogen), time-shifting electricity demand (demand response management) and/or through significantly expanded inter-state and international grid connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina first discussed India exporting its exceptionally low-cost solar energy from Gujarat and Rajasthan to Bangladesh in 2019. Even accounting for the grid transmission costs doubling the cost of delivered electricity, with solar as low as Rs2.50/kWh (and going below Rs2 later this decade), this power can be delivered at a substantial discount to Bangladesh’s wholesale electricity price, which is double that of India due to Bangladesh’s increasing reliance on expensive, dirty, imported coal, diesel and LNG.\n",
      "\n",
      "The One Sun, One World, One Grid vision goes further. A 1,000km subsea HVDC connection from Oman to Gujarat would take ultra-low cost solar electricity (built by leading installers like India’s very own Sterling & Wilson) in the middle of the Oman and UAE afternoon and deliver it into the evening peak in Dhaka. Adding to solar from Ladakh and hydro-electricity from Nepal, potentially to Colombo as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Virtually unlimited low-cost renewables are available today at massive scale in India, with zero inflation indexation for 25 years. This is entirely sustainable power producing no carbon emissions and no air or water pollution. Deflationary green exports can realistically entirely replace expensive, inflationary, polluting fossil fuel imports, with vision and international co-operation, bringing employment and international investment.\n",

      "Chandigarh, June 15\n",
      "\n",
      "Expressing Punjab’s reservations on the amendments, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on Monday, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the three recently issued central government ordinances related to the farming sector, in the interest of farmers, and taking into account the spirit of ‘cooperative federalism’ which the letter has always strongly championed, a press release by the state government read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underlining the need for the Centre and the states to work together to secure the collective good of the people of the country, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a reconsideration of the three ordinances — for permitting trade in agricultural produce outside the physical boundaries of the set-up of the agricultural market under the APMC Act, easing of easing restrictions under the Essential Commodities Act and facilitating contract farming.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three should be revisited keeping in view the concerns and the interests of farmers, said Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, seeking protection of farmers’ interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh pointed out that Punjab had been at the forefront of ensuring food security for the country. The development of crop production technology for wheat and paddy as well as its dissemination, supported by the assured procurement at minimum support price (MSP) by the FCI in the notified markets, had played a key role in building up buffer stocks and making the country self-reliant, he stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of this policy, observed Captain Amarinder, were most visible in the recent past when the country was able to face the unprecedented crisis emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic with confidence, with no threat of hunger and food deprivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the Punjab Chief Minister pointed that agriculture was a subject entrusted to the sates by the makers of the Indian Constitution and features at entry 14 on the State List. On the other hand, the trade and commerce feature in entry 33 of the Concurrent List, which enabled both the Union and states government to legislate on the subject, provided the state legislation is not repugnant, to the legislation of the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Referring to the specific ordinances, the Chief Minister said the Agriculture Produce Marketing System in Punjab had stood the test of time and served the State and the country well over the last 60 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had in fact been an important contributor to the success of the ‘Green Revolution’, he said, adding that it had helped in ensuring food security on the one hand and securing livelihoods of millions of farmers and farmworkers on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, he pointed out that a well-developed infrastructure has also been created in Punjab, both for open marketing and storage of produce and seamless transportation of produce from farm-gate to 'mandis' and godowns. The state government was in the process of further upgrading this infrastructure to support modern farming and agri-marketing practices, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the changes as per the Ordinance dated June 5, 2020, in the agricultural marketing system, had led to widespread apprehension among farmers of the state that the Union Government was planning to withdraw from the assured procurement of food grains produced by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that there was also another apprehension that the proposed barrier-free nation-wide markets for farmers would really come to mean a nation-wide market for traders, possibly to the detriment of the already debt-ridden and beleaguered farmers of the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming as it does in the times of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, it would further exacerbate the socio-economic tensions among farmers of the state, said the Chief Minister, adding that this would not at all be conducive for the peace and development of the region, which faces serious challenges of public order due to a live international border.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing the Prime Minister’s attention to “The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020”, Captain Amarinder said it permitted new marketing channels outside the APMC domain and had, thus, far-reaching implications for the states, particularly Punjab.\n",
      "\n",

      "It is a matter of common understanding that entry 33 of the Concurrent List i.e. “trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of the products…”, is applicable only to foodstuffs such as raw cotton, jute, oilseeds, etc., which are industrial raw materials and not to food grains, fruits, and vegetables, he said, adding that there thus appeared to be no rationale to infringe upon the APMC Act or for that matter, the autonomy of the States enshrined in the Constitution within the time-tested federal framework.\n",

      "Chandigarh, June 15\n",
      "\n",
      "Expressing Punjab’s reservations on the amendments, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on Monday, urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the three recently issued central government ordinances related to the farming sector, in the interest of farmers, and taking into account the spirit of ‘cooperative federalism’ which the letter has always strongly championed, a press release by the state government read.\n",
      "\n",
      "Underlining the need for the Centre and the states to work together to secure the collective good of the people of the country, Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking a reconsideration of the three ordinances — for permitting trade in agricultural produce outside the physical boundaries of the set-up of the agricultural market under the APMC Act, easing of easing restrictions under the Essential Commodities Act and facilitating contract farming.\n",
      "\n",
      "All three should be revisited keeping in view the concerns and the interests of farmers, said Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, seeking protection of farmers’ interests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh pointed out that Punjab had been at the forefront of ensuring food security for the country. The development of crop production technology for wheat and paddy as well as its dissemination, supported by the assured procurement at minimum support price (MSP) by the FCI in the notified markets, had played a key role in building up buffer stocks and making the country self-reliant, he stressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results of this policy, observed Captain Amarinder, were most visible in the recent past when the country was able to face the unprecedented crisis emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic with confidence, with no threat of hunger and food deprivation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, the Punjab Chief Minister pointed that agriculture was a subject entrusted to the sates by the makers of the Indian Constitution and features at entry 14 on the State List. On the other hand, the trade and commerce feature in entry 33 of the Concurrent List, which enabled both the Union and states government to legislate on the subject, provided the state legislation is not repugnant, to the legislation of the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "Referring to the specific ordinances, the Chief Minister said the Agriculture Produce Marketing System in Punjab had stood the test of time and served the State and the country well over the last 60 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "It had in fact been an important contributor to the success of the ‘Green Revolution’, he said, adding that it had helped in ensuring food security on the one hand and securing livelihoods of millions of farmers and farmworkers on the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, he pointed out that a well-developed infrastructure has also been created in Punjab, both for open marketing and storage of produce and seamless transportation of produce from farm-gate to 'mandis' and godowns. The state government was in the process of further upgrading this infrastructure to support modern farming and agri-marketing practices, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the changes as per the Ordinance dated June 5, 2020, in the agricultural marketing system, had led to widespread apprehension among farmers of the state that the Union Government was planning to withdraw from the assured procurement of food grains produced by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that there was also another apprehension that the proposed barrier-free nation-wide markets for farmers would really come to mean a nation-wide market for traders, possibly to the detriment of the already debt-ridden and beleaguered farmers of the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming as it does in the times of the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, it would further exacerbate the socio-economic tensions among farmers of the state, said the Chief Minister, adding that this would not at all be conducive for the peace and development of the region, which faces serious challenges of public order due to a live international border.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing the Prime Minister’s attention to “The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020”, Captain Amarinder said it permitted new marketing channels outside the APMC domain and had, thus, far-reaching implications for the states, particularly Punjab.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the levies/fees charged by the APMCs were used for the development and management of 'mandis', the creation of rural marketing, and supporting infrastructure, as well as for the welfare of rural farming and non-farming communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a matter of common understanding that entry 33 of the Concurrent List i.e. “trade and commerce in, and the production, supply and distribution of the products…”, is applicable only to foodstuffs such as raw cotton, jute, oilseeds, etc., which are industrial raw materials and not to food grains, fruits, and vegetables, he said, adding that there thus appeared to be no rationale to infringe upon the APMC Act or for that matter, the autonomy of the States enshrined in the Constitution within the time-tested federal framework.\n",
